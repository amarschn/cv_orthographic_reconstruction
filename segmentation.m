function [ new_edges ] = segmentation( vertices, edges )
    %UNTITLED Summary of this function goes here
    %   Detailed explanation goes here
    
    % An object can be represented as many different sets of edges in a DXF
    % file orthographic view, and this function returns all possible edges
    % given a set of vertices and edges representing an object view
    
    % In order to accomplish this, every edge must be checked for possible
    % intermediate vertices. If there is a possible intermediate vertex
    % along an edge, then 2 new edges are added to the list of "new edges"
    % which
